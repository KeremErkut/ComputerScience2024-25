##  Example 1: *Guess the Number Program*

The user is prompted to guess a number between 1 and 5. The program ensures that the input is within the specified range and checks if the guessed number is correct.

>### How It Works
1. The program uses a `do-while` loop to repeatedly prompt the user until they enter a valid number (1 to 5).
2. Once a valid input is provided, the program checks whether the guess matches the predefined correct number (in this case, `3`).
3. If the guess is correct, the program displays:  
   **`You guessed right.`**
4. If the guess is incorrect, the program displays:  
   **`You guessed wrong.`**

>### Key Features
- **Input Validation:** Ensures that the user enters a number within the specified range (1 to 5).
- **Interactive Feedback:** Provides immediate feedback on the user's guess.

This program demonstrates basic concepts in C, including loops, conditionals, and input validation. It is a great example for beginners to understand how to manage user input and create simple logic-based programs.

##  Example 2: Happy Birthday Program

This program repeatedly prints "Happy Birthday" based on the user's input for their age. It demonstrates the use of a `do-while` loop for controlled repetition.

>### How It Works
1. The program prompts the user to enter their age.
2. Using a `do-while` loop, the program prints "Happy Birthday" once for each year of the user's age.
3. The loop continues until the count matches the entered age.

>### Key Features
- **Dynamic Repetition:** The number of repetitions is determined by the user's input.
- **Simple Loop Logic:** Demonstrates the use of a `do-while` loop for beginners.
- **Interactive Output:** The program outputs a celebratory message for each year of age.

This program is an excellent example for beginners learning how to work with loops and user input in C. It combines basic input handling with simple repetition logic.

## Example 3 : Animal Sound Program

This program asks the user if they have a "cat" or a "dog" and responds with the corresponding animal sound.

>### How It Works
1. The program prompts the user to input either `cat` or `dog`.
2. Based on the input:
   - If the input is `cat`, it prints: **`meow`**.
   - If the input is `dog`, it prints: **`woof`**.
3. For any other input, it prints: **`I don't know what sound that animal makes`**.


>### Key Features
- Simple input handling with `scanf`.
- String comparison using `strcmp`.
- Basic conditional logic with `if-else`.

This program is a fun way to practice handling strings and conditionals in C.

## Example 4: Even Number Printer

This program prints all even numbers starting from 2 up to a specified value (`10` in this case). 

>### How It Works
1. The program initializes two variables:
   - `i` is set to `2` (the starting point).
   - `a` is set to `10` (the upper limit).
2. Using a `do-while` loop:
   - It prints the current value of `i`.
   - It increments `i` by `2` on each iteration.
3. The loop continues until `i` exceeds `a`.


>### Features
- Demonstrates the use of a `do-while` loop in C.
- Prints a sequence of even numbers within a defined range.

## Example 5 :Say Hello Program

This program asks for the user's name and greets them with a personalized message.

>### How It Works
1. The program defines a function `sayHello` that:
   - Prompts the user to enter their name.
   - Reads the input and stores it in a character array.
   - Prints a greeting message with the entered name.
2. The `sayHello` function is called from the `main` function.

>### Key Features
- Demonstrates the use of a custom function in C.
- Includes basic user input handling with `scanf`.
- Provides a friendly and interactive output.
